<p><a href="SeriesReport-20190417162656_88dfa7 coal_mining_data.xlsx">This dataset</a> shows the number of coal miners employed 
  in the United States, by month, from 1985 to 2019. I hope to demonstrate the rate at which coal mininers have decreased in the 
  United States over time and reveal patterns in this change.</p>
    <p><a href="arcData.csv">This dataset</a> shows economic information about Appalachian counties. It includes 
      data about the unemployment rates, per capita market incomes, and poverty rates. 
      I hope to show these numbers in comparison to state and national averages which are also included in the CSV
      to reveal information about the Appalachian region.</p>
