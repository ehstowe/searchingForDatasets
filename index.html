<p><a href="SeriesReport-20190417162656_88dfa7 coal_mining_data.xlsx">This dataset</a> shows the number of coal miners employed 
  in the United States, by month, from 1985 to 2019. I hope to demonstrate the rate at which coal mininers have decreased in the 
  United States over time.</p>
    <p><a href="arcData.csv">This dataset</a> shows economic information about Appalachian counties. I hope to show these
      numbers in comparison to state and national averages which are also included in the CSV.</p>
